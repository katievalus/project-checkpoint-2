    <h2>Habbits and Health</h2>
    <p>Nutrition is a huge part of living a healthy life. But nutrition must be complemented by good habits and lifestyle choices.
        Nutition, exercise, and mental health are a huge part of how I live my life. I start every day with a green smoothie. 
        This gives me energy for the day and makes me feel good. I have also worked hard to find out foods that trigger my GI system. Through
        lots of experimenting with foods, I have found that avoiding gluten and dairy works best for me.

    <h1>Workouts</h1>

    <h2>Peloton</h2>
    <p>Staying active is the key part of a healthy lifestyle. Growing up as a gymnast and field hockey player, I was always aactive.
        When these sports ended for me, I didn't know how to stay in shape. I tried many workouts but stuggled finding one that I loved. In 2020, 
        I got a peloton. This purchase changed my life! Cycling is my go to workout, a great way to do cardio and build muscle. There are so many classes
        to choose from and I always end up having a great workout. </p>

    <h2>Solidcore</h2>
        <p>Another big part of my workout routine is pilates. I discovered pilates this past summer,
        and I am obsessed. My studio is [solidcore], where I talk classes in CT and MI. This workout will leave you sore for days, and I've never 
        taken a class that actually shows results! </p>

    <div>
    <h2>Mental Health</h2>
    <p>Reading is a great outlet, especially when I am mentally overwhelmed. Over the summer I got really into reading. I find that it 
        relaxes me, and it improves my mental health. My favorite author is Colleen Hoover. My favorite work from her is "It Ends With Us", "Ugly Love",
        and "Verity". I am always looking for new book reccomdations.
